Welcome to **Tectonic**, a world generation project that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.

## Important Notes

<summary>Supported Versions</summary>

All versions with a ✔️ are currently supported and will receive bug fixes and changes.

All versions with a ❌ or not present on the table are not supported and will receive no future changes.

<summary>Biome Mod Compatibility</summary>

**Most Biome Mods (BOP, RU, NS, BWG)**

Tectonic is compatible with mods that rely on Terrablender or Biolith to add their biomes to worldgen. This includes Biomes O Plenty, Regions Unexplored, Nature's Spirit, and more.

**Terralith**

Tectonic has a special version with Terralith compatibility. This version is shipped in the mod version of Tectonic, but it is available as a standalone datapack [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic).

**CliffTree**

On 1.20, Tectonic and Clifftree are **not** compatible.

On 1.21, Tectonic needs some small tweaks to work with CliffTree. These tweaks are shipped with the mod version of Tectonic, but they are available as a datapack [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/clifftree-tectonic).

## Features

The mod version of Tectonic has a config for editing many of the following features. Tectonic v3 has a config screen, making it easier than ever to know what certain fields do and to configure them in-game.

---

### Continents and Islands
In Tectonic v3, terrain forms into continent-like landmasses. Continents will generate thousands to tens of thousands of blocks wide, tailored to account for the project's massive mountain ranges and new terrain types.

In the oceans between continents you'll find relatively smaller "islands", ranging up to around a thousand blocks across. These islands use vanilla's mountain terrain shaping, now making it possible to find traditional mountain rings. 

With Terralith installed, these islands spawn Calderas and Volcanoes!

---

### Deeper Oceans

Oceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer! Deep oceans in particular have more varied terrain, featuring overhangs and valleys.

If the mod version is installed, vanilla Ocean Monuments will generate deeper to compensate for the deeper oceans.

---

### Mountain Ranges

The biggest highlight of Tectonic's terrain is the massive mountain ranges. They can stretch for tens of thousands of blocks, going high enough to approach the build limit!

---

### Underground Rivers

In mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers. These rivers vary vastly in size and shape.

If the mod version is installed, these will have increased glow lichen and rare areas with lanterns!

---

### Lava Rivers

*Very* deep underground, you can find a deeper variant of lava rivers with different shaping and lava instead of water.

---

### Jungle Pillars

Some jungles feature massive pillars that can extend upwards of a hundred blocks tall!

---

### Canyons

Some badlands will generate *very* large canyons, making them a spectacle to find and travel through.

---

### Dunes

Most deserts will generate smooth, rolling dunes.

---

### Plateaus

In some areas, towering 2-3 tiered plateaus will generate. These plateaus will sometimes have smoother "ramps" to make exploration in survival more accessible.

Badlands also feature isolated plateaus, not directly bound to nearby rivers.

---

### Valleys

While plateaus usually elevate plateau biomes, some Cherry Groves and Pale Gardens have the plateaus surround the biome, turning the biome into a valley.

---

### Wetlands

Some forest, jungle and taiga biomes generate very close to sea level and generate frequent ponds and lakes.
